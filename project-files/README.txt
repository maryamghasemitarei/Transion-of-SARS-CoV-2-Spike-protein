This folder containes:
1- molecular dynamics parameters for GROMACS 2020 software (.mdp files)
2- the zipped file named "native_down" contains all input files for molecular dynamics simulation of native spike protein in the down conformation.
3- the zipped file named "native_up" contains all input files for molecular dynamics simulation of native spike protein in the up conformation.
4- the zipped file named "oxidized_down" contains all input files of simulation of oxidized spike protein in the down conformation.
5- the zipped file named "oxidized_up" contains all input files of simulation  of oxidized spike protein in the up conformation.
6- the folder named "TMD-native" contains all input files of targeted MD simulation of native system from down to up and up to down.
7- the folder named "TMD-oxidized" contains all input files of targeted MD simulation of oxidized system from down to up and up to down.
8- the folder named "US-simulations" contains all input files necessary for umbrella sampling simulation of native and oxidized system.

Any sub-folder and zipped file have its own README file.
