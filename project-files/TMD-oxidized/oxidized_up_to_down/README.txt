This folder containes:
1- molecular dynamics parameters for GROMACS 2020 software (.mdp files)
2- targeted MD parameters for PLUMED-2.6.0 software (plumed.dat)
3- the zipped files named "replica_1", "replica_2", "replica_3", "replica_4", "replica_5", "replica_6", "replica_7", "replica_8", and "replica_9" contain all input files for the targeted MD simulations, capturing the transition of the oxidized SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein from the up to the down configuration for 9 different systems.

Any zipped file has its own README file.
